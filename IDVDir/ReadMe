My notes on how to build IDV ...

1. IDV.jar relies on an updated TptpParser.jar in Source/parser. Note that
   Source/parser/tptp_parser is a symbolic link to my development source.
   > cd Source/parser
   > make
   > cp TptpParser ../..    # Not sure if this is even required
2. Now make a new IDV.jar
   > cd Source
   > make
   > cp IDV.jar ..
3. Now put the new .jars onto the web
   > cp IDV.jar TptpParser.jar ~/public_html/JARS

Steven's old notes to me ...

But here is the tgz'd:

http://web.cs.miami.edu/home/strac/geoff/IDV-2008.10.31b.tgz

just tar xzvf,
and then cross your fingers and make.

This should create and IDV.jar located in the main directory.  This
also compiles a fresh tptp_praser.jar in the parser directory.  That
directory also includes the antlr.jar file.

The file is TPTPReader.java, it resides in the main directory.

The function that reads it is called readTPTP (BufferedReader in,
BufferedReader coord, IDV idv);

"in" is the tptp stream
"coord" is the possible coordinate stream supplied by CLayout
"idv" is just a link back to the idv window object.

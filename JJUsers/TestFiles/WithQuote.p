cnf(i_0_1162,plain,(s__documentation(s__ConstantQuantity,s__EnglishLanguage,'A &%ConstantQuantity is a &%PhysicalQuantity that has a constant value, e.g. 3 &%Meters and 5 &%HourDurations. The magnitude (see &%MagnitudeFn) of every &%ConstantQuantity is a &%RealNumber. &%ConstantQuantity is distinguished from &%FunctionQuantity, in that each instance of the latter is formed through the mapping of one &%PhysicalQuantity to another &%PhysicalQuantity. Each instance of &%ConstantQuantity is expressed with the &%BinaryFunction &%MeasureFn, which takes a &%Number and a &%UnitOfMeasure as arguments. For example, 3 &%Meters is expressed as (&%MeasureFn 3 &%Meter). Instances of &%ConstantQuantity form a partial order (see &%PartialOrderingRelation) with the &%lessThan relation, since &%lessThan is a &%RelationExtendedToQuantities and &%lessThan is defined over the &%RealNumbers. The &%lessThan relation is reserved_not a total order (see &%TotalOrderingRelation) over the class &%ConstantQuantity since elements of some subclasses of &%ConstantQuantity (such as length quantities) are incomparable to elements of other subclasses of &%ConstantQuantity (such as mass quantities).'))).

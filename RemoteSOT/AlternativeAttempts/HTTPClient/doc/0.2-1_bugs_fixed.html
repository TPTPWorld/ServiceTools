<H1>Bugs fixed in V0.2-1</H1>

<P>There were a few bugs in the initial release of Version 0.2 which were
fixed in the current bug fix release. Here is the list of them:

<UL>

<LI>When using the methods <var>HTTPConnection.Head(file, form_data)</var>,
<var>HTTPConnection.Head(file, form_data, hdrs)</var>,
<var>HTTPConnection.Get(file, form_data)</var> and
<var>HTTPConnection.Get(file, form_data, hdrs)</var> the form_data was
URL-encoded twice instead of once.

<LI>If the first request returned with a status code of 4xx or 5xx and
the server is doing HTTP/1.0 then the request threw an EOFException.
This happens for instance when the server requests authorization, or
when the file doesn't exists, or if the server does not accept the
request method.

<LI>This one is not really a bug, but may be a nuisance: a thread is
started in the HTTPClient to handle certain timeouts. In some cases this
thread was suspended and never killed. The main effect was that some
applications would seem to hang at the end, as the VM waits for all threads
to die before exiting. Note though that if you start any windows stuff
(this includes the authorization box popup in the HTTPClient) then there
will always be a few threads hanging around when it's time to end. One
way of forcing the program to exit is to call <var>System.exit()</var>
when it's time to end.

<LI>Under certain circumstances if an IOException occured during a request
then this Exception was not properly thrown; this resulted in a
NullPointerError in <var>StreamDemultiplexor.read()</var> shortly afterwards.

</UL>

<P>Thanx to the following people for finding and helping me fix these bugs:
Gil Bregman, Martin Heinzl, Akkana Peck, Olivier Baujard.

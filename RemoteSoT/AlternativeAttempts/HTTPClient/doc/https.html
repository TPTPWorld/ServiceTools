<H1>HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) Support</H1>

<P>Even though support for https has been one of the most requested
features, it has still not been added in yet. This is mainly due to the
lack of a suitable SSL implementation (where suitable means freely
available under some sort of opensource license, pure Java, and without
export restrictions). However, a number of patches for various commercial
and partially free SSL packages have been provided by various people (who
all deserve a big thank you). Below is the list of patches available.
Note: I suggest you check the <A
HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/https.html"> copy of this
page</A> on the HTTPClient web site, as that will be more up-to-date.

<P>All patches include the modified HTTPConnection.java, the resulting
class files, and a README. Note that the patches are not included in the
HTTPClient distributions themselves because of export/import regulations
in various countries. However, they are all available from the HTTPClient
home site, which resides in Switzerland and therefore has no export
problems.

<P>If you have not settled on an SSL implementation yet and are choosing
between one of those listed below, then I recommend JSSE, SSL-J,
iSaSiLk, or SSLava, because they have the necessary constructor or other
hook so that the HTTPClient will work through proxies; the others do not
provide the necessary constructors or hooks and therefore when using
these the HTTPClient will not work through proxies for https
connections. Note that I have no connection whatsoever with these
companies - I just happen to have received info and patches for these
packages from folks who had used them to add https support to the
HTTPClient.


<H2>https Examples</H2>

Once you've patched the HTTPClient and added the ssl libraries to your
classpath, creating an https connection is simple:

<PRE>
    HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection("https", "www.myaddr.net", -1);
    ...
</PRE>

You can also use URL's, but you need to define the property
<code>java.protocol.handler.pkgs=HTTPClient</code> so that creating the
URL won't throw a MalformedURLException:

<PRE>
    System.getProperties().put("java.protocol.handler.pkgs", "HTTPClient");
    URL url = new URL("https://www.myaddr.net/the/stuff");
    HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(url);
    ...
</PRE>

Alternatively, use the URI class from the HTTPClient:

<PRE>
    URI url = new URI("https://www.myaddr.net/the/stuff");
    HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(url.getScheme(), url.getHost(), url.getPort());
    ...
</PRE>


<H2>SSL Implementations and Patches</H2>

<H3><A NAME="SSLJ" HREF="http://www.rsasecurity.com/products/bsafe/sslj.html">SSL-J</A> (from RSA)</H3>

<P>SSL-J is commercial; the patched HTTPClient is capable of doing https
through proxies. Thanks to Jon Lennard and Chaitanya Laxminarayan for the patches.
<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLJ3.zip">Patches for SSL-J version 3.0 (or later)</A>
<BR><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLJ2.zip">Patches for SSL-J versions prior to 3.0</A>

<H3><A NAME="SSLava" HREF="http://www.phaos.com/products/sslava.htm">SSLava</A> (from Phaos)</H3>

<P>SSLava is commercial; the patched HTTPClient is capable
of doing https through proxies. Thanks to Josh Bers for the patch.
<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLava.zip">Download patches</A>

<P><em>Note:</em> the patch above has been updated to work against what
seems to be the current SSLava version. If you have an older version of
SSLava and are having problems with the patch, then try downloading
<A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLava.old.zip">the older patches</A>

<H3><A NAME="IAIK" HREF="http://jcewww.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/iSaSiLk/iSaSiLk.htm">iSaSiLk</A> (from IAIK)</H3>

<P>iSaSiLk is commercial; the patched HTTPClient is partially capable
of doing https through proxies (http proxies are ok, SOCKS proxies
aren't handled). Thanks to Scott Murray for the info from which this
patch was created.

<P>Note: Entrust is distributing a security
<A HREF="http://www.entrust.com/developer/java/index.htm">toolkit</A> which
is free for some uses. This package includes the above IAIK SSL
implementation, and hence the patches here can be used with Entrust's
toolkit.

<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLiaik.zip">Download patches</A>

<H3><A NAME="NJSS" HREF="http://home.netscape.com/download/prodinfonfs_102.html">NJSS</A> (from Netscape)</H3>

<P>NJSS is commercial; the patched HTTPClient is <em>not</em> capable
of doing https through proxies. Thanks to J. Scott Evans for the patch.
<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLnjss.zip">Download patches</A>

<H3><A NAME="JSSE" HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">JSSE</A> (from Sun)</H3>

<P>This is a pure java implementation of the latest javax.net.ssl spec.
DSTC also <A HREF="http://security.dstc.edu.au/projects/java/jcsi.html">
provides an implementation</A> of this interface, which is free for
non-commercial use. The patched HTTPClient is capable of doing https
through proxies.

<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/JSSE.zip">Download
patches</A>

<H3><A NAME="SUN" HREF="http://java.sun.com/security/ssl/API_users_guide.html">Old javax.net.ssl</A> (from Sun)</H3>

<P>Sun's implementation of this interface delivered with <A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/1.1.5/">HotJava 1.1.5</A> is
free (at the time of this writing there is no SSL-enabled version of
HotJava 3.0); others seem to be commercial; the patched HTTPClient is
<em>not</em> capable of doing https through proxies.

<P><A HREF="http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/SSLsun.zip">Download
patches</A>

<H3><A NAME="SUN" HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</A></H3>

<P>A few people have written Java wrappers around OpenSSL and have
provided patches for the HTTPClient. Here are the ones I'm aware of:

<UL>
<LI>Matt Warner's
    <A HREF="http://www.warnertechnology.com/Computers/Software/JavaOpenSSL.shtml">wrapper info</A>
    (patches for the HTTPClient are at the end of the page).
    This is currently mainly Mac OS X based, but should be portable
    to any Unix.
<LI>Martin Büchler's <A HREF="SSLJava-0.1.zip">wrapper for Win32</A>
    (with a patched HTTPConnection.java).
</UL>

Note that neither of these support SSL through proxies.

<H3>Other SSL packages</H3>

<P>Here are some SSL packages which I know of, but for which I do not
have any patches:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.bpsinfo.com/javassl/">Java SSL</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.vonnieda.org/SSLv3/">EspreSSL</A>
</UL>


<H3>Using Other SSL Implementations</H3>

<P>If you have an SSL implementation which is not listed above and which
you'd like to use, then must make the following modifications to
HTTPConnection.java:

<UL>
<LI>Uncomment (and suitably modify) the line
    <PRE>
	sock = new SSLSocket(sock); </PRE>

<LI>Chang the line
    <PRE>
	if (!prot.equals("http")) </PRE>
    to read
    <PRE>
	if (!prot.equals("http")  &&  !prot.equals("https")) </PRE>.
</UL>

<P>Note that you'll need an SSL implementation with a constructor
which takes an already established socket (this is because the
HTTPClient needs to create the raw connection itself, possibly
going through SOCKS or http proxies, and only then can the SSL
handshake be invoked). As an alternative, a startHandshake()
or equivalent method will also do - see the <A HREF="#IAIK">IAIK</A>
implementation. If the SSL package provides neither option then
the client will not work through proxies.

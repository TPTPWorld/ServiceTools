Provides the {@link java.net.URLStreamHandler URLStreamHandler} for the
http scheme. This is not meant to be used directly, but instead is
intended for use by {@link java.net.URL java.net.URL}. When you set the
java system property <var>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</var> to
"HTTPClient", java.net.URL will look for and use this stream handler to
create and return a URLConnection instance whenever
<code>openConnection</code> is invoked on a URL with the "http" scheme.

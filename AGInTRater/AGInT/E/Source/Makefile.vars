# ======================

# Remove the comment from the following to enable gprof-style
#  profiling 
#  -> This will break some stuff on at least some Solaris 2.6
#     machines, which seem to lack a profiling-enabled libm. I have a
#     simple sqrt() imlementation to circumvent the problem...

LIBS = -lm

# BUILDFLAGS:
#
# PRINT_SOMEERRORS_STDOUT: Print various error messages (out of
#                          memory, empty input file) to stdout  
#                          (otherwise only to stderr) 
# USE_NEWMEM: Use a memory management system like everybody else,
#             using free lists filled up by allocating large blocks
#             and hacking them  into suitabe pieces. Contrary to
#             common expectations, this slows E down between 5 and 15%
#             (depending on hardware architecture and problem)
#             compared to its native memory management. It's
#             left in as a warning reminder only.
# USE_SYSTEM_MEM: Use normal malloc()/free instead of the build-in
#                  memory management. Does not combine with USE_NEWMEM! 
#
# MEASURE_EXPENSIVE: Compile counting operations and things into the
#                    code even in time-critical sections.
# PRINT_SHARING: Determine and print the sharing factor of the proof
#                state for each clause activation. 
# PRINT_RW_STATE: Dump R,E,NEW in each loop traversal.
#
# FULL_MEM_STATS: Print size of the most important data types and
#                 information about allocated memory. 
# CONSTANT_MEM_ESTIMATE: Use normalized portable data type estimates
#                        instead of sizeof() to get actual machine data 
#                        sizes. Necessary to make the prover behave _exactly_
#                        the same on different machines, but makes memory 
#                        estimation worse on most machines!
# STACK_SIZE=VALUE: Increase the system stacksize to value and run a
#                   freshly exec()'ed copy of E. This seems to work
#                   well, but is not debug-friendly. Disable and use
#                   limit/ulimit for debuging.

The E Equational Theorem Prover
===============================

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for clausal logic. That
means it is a program that you can stuff a mathematical specification
(in clausal logic with equality) and a hypothesis into, and which will
then run forever, using up all of your machines resources. Very
occasionally it will find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you so
;-).

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants. It installs
cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my hands on: Various
versions of Linux/Intel and Linux/SPARC, SunOS, Solaris and HPUX.

If this already sounds exiting to you, go download your version from
http://wwwjessen.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html.

If not, consider the following points:

1) Won't cause a new desktop war. The program is extremely useless to
   most end users.
2) Impress your Comp. Sci. Prof!
3) High Hack Value!

E is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

Have fun!

This is the announcement for version 0.24 of E.

Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.announce
Subject: E Equational Theorem Prover version 0.24 "Yunnan" released
Summary: Announcement of availability of the E thorem prover.
Keywords: E, equational theorem proving, ATP


The E equational theorem prover version 0.24 "Yunnan" has been
released.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for clausal logic with
equality. Thus, you can specify a mathematical problem (e.g. a
mathematical puzzle), a (small) piece of program code or some hardware
elements in clausal logic (using rules of the form "If A and B and C
then D or E or F" in a PROLOG-like syntax), and try to have the system
prove certain properties of the described structure. Be warned that
this can consume inane amounts of CPU time and memory for non-trivial
problems.

As an example, the following piece of specification (PUZ003-1 from the
TPTP v2.1.0 problem library for theorem provers) describes a barber
club where a certain rule about shaving exist, namely, that each
member who shaves a member will be shaved by all members in turn.


shaved(members, X) <- 
    member(X),
    member(Y),
    shaved(X, Y).

shaved(Y, X) <- 
    shaved(members, X),
    member(Y).

member(guido) <- .

member(lorenzo) <- .

member(petruchio) <- .

member(cesare) <- .

shaved(guido, cesare) <- .


If you add the following query, the prover will prove (in about 0.03
seconds on a 143 MHz UltraSparc 1) that Petrucio shaved Lorenzo:


<- shaved(petruchio, lorenzo).


E is based on a variant of the the superposition calculus described by
Bachmair and Ganzinger, and is especially useful for problems
containing equality. Version 0.24 "Yunnan" is the first stable and
hopefully bug-free release that can deal efficiently with full clausal
logic. It is still very much work in progress, and new versions should
be released soon.

The program is available as a source distribution for UNIX-like
systems. It installs cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my
hands on: Various versions of GNU/Linux for Intel and SPARC, SunOS,
Solaris and HPUX. The prover is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.

You can get the latest stable release from

equality. Thus, you can specify a mathematical problem (e.g. a
mathematical puzzle), a (small) piece of program code or some hardware

prove certain properties of the described structure. Be warned that
this can consume inane (in fact, theoretically unlimited) amounts of
CPU time and memory for diffcult problems.

E version 0.3. is the most polished version released so far. It now
features a special mode to allow the prover to select all parameters
automatically, so that even new users can get some use out of it. E
0.3 has been tested on all 3275 CNF problems of the TPTP problem
library for theorem provers, and showed no unexpected
behaviour. Results are available from the E web page.

this can consume inane (in fact, theoretically unlimited) amounts of
CPU time and memory for diffcult problems.

Version 0.31 improves on the previous version in a variety of ways:

- The inference engine is much faster.
- The automatic mode for selecting search heuristics has been
  improved. 
- When memory is low, the prover will now discard some clauses with
  very bad evaluations. This makes it possible to get good results
  even with low to medium amounts of memory (32 MB should work fine
  even for many hard proof problems).
- The prover can now read and write native TPTP format in addition to
  E-LOP. 
- Various minor changes.

This is the announcement for version 0.99X of E.

From: schulz@eprover.org (Stephan Schulz)
Newsgroups: comp.ai
Subject: E Equational Theorem Prover 0.99 "Singtom" released
Summary: Announcement of availability of the E theorem prover.
Keywords: E, equational theorem proving, ATP
Followup-To: comp.theory

E 0.99 "Singtom" is the latest version of the successful theorem
prover for first order logic.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for full first order logic
with equality. It has successfully competed in several CASC
competitions and is generally considered a friendly and powerful
system (as theorem provers go).

The new version has (again) improved heuristics and search behaviour,
better proof object generation, better clause splitting, and updates
to comply with the latest TPTP-3 syntax.

E is available as a source distribution for UNIX-variants. It installs
cleanly under all UNIX variants I could get my hands on: Various
versions of GNU/Linux for Intel and SPARC, Solaris, HPUX and
MacOS-X. Users have reported successful builds on a large number of
other systems, including Windows/Cygwin.

E 0.999 "Longview" is the latest version of the successful theorem
prover for first order logic with equality.

E is a a purely equational theorem prover for full first order logic
with equality. It has successfully competed in several CASC
competitions and is generally considered a friendly and powerful
system (as theorem provers go).

The new version has several improvements of the internal inference
engine, bug fixes (especially to support tools that suffered from bit
rot), and updates to comply with the latest TPTP-3 syntax.

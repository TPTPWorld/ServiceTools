Package name: eprover
SHORT: Theorem prover for first-order logic with equality
LONG:
 E is a fully automatic theorem prover for full first-order logic with
 equality. It accepts a mathematical specification and, optionally, a
 hypothesis, and tries to prove the hypothesis and/or find a
 saturation representing a (counter-)model for the specification.
 .
 E is based on a purely equational problem representation and
 implements a variant of the superposition calculus. Proof search can
 be guided with a multitude of options or a powerful automatic
 configuration mode. The system can process input in a number of
 different formats, including the standard TPTP-2 and TPTP-3
 formats. It can generate proof objects in PCL2 or TPTP-3/TSTP
 format.
 .
 E is considered one of the most powerful and friendly automated
 theorem provers for first-order logic. It has consistently been among
 the top systems in the major categories of the CASC system
 competition, and has usually been the strongest free software
 system.

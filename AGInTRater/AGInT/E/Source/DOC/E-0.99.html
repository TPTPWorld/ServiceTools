<h3>Architecture</h3>

E&nbsp;0.99[<a href="#References">Sch2002,Sch2004</a>] is a purely
equational theorem prover. The core proof procedure operates on
formulas in clause normal form, using a calculus that combines
superposition (with selection of negative literals) and rewriting. No
special rules for non-equational literals have been implemented, i.e.,
resolution is simulated via paramodulation and equality
resolution. The basic calculus is extended with rules for AC
redundancy elemination, some contextual simplification, and
pseudo-splitting. The latest version of E also supports simultaneous
paramodulation, either for all inferences or for selected inferences.
<p>
E is based on the DISCOUNT-loop variant of the <em>given-clause</em>
algorithm, i.e. a strict separation of active and passive facts.
Proof search in E is primarily controlled by a literal selection
strategy, a clause evaluation heuristic, and a simplification
ordering. The prover supports a large number of preprogrammed literal
selection strategies, many of which are only experimental. Clause
evaluation heuristics can be constructed on the fly by combining
various parameterized primitive evaluation functions, or can be
selected from a set of predefined heuristics. Supported term orderings
are several parameterized instances of Knuth-Bendix-Ordering (KBO) and
Lexicographic Path Ordering (LPO).
<p>
The prover uses a preprocessing step to convert formulas in full first
order format to clause normal form. This step may introduce
(first-order) definitions to avoid an exponential growth of the
formula. Preprocessing also unfolds equational definitions and
performs some simplifications on the clause level.
<p>
The automatic mode determines literal selection strategy, term
ordering, and search heuristic based on simple problem characteristics
of the preprocessed clausal problem.
<p>
EP&nbsp;0.99 is just a combination of E&nbsp;0.99 in verbose mode and
a proof analysis tool extracting the used inference steps.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

E is implemented in ANSI C, using the GNU C compiler. The most
outstanding feature is the global sharing of rewrite steps. Current
versions of E add <em>rewrite links</em> from rewritten to new
terms. In effect, E is caching rewrite operations as long as
sufficient memory is available. Other important features are the use
of <em>perfect discrimination trees</em> with age and size constraints
for rewriting and unit-subsumption, <em>feature vector
indexing</em>[<a href="#References">Sch2004b</a>] for forward- and
backward subsumption and contextual literal cutting, and a new
polynomial implementation of LPO[<a href="#References">Loe2004</a>].
<p>
The program has been successfully installed under SunOS&nbsp;4.3.x,
Solaris&nbsp;2.x, HP-UX&nbsp;B&nbsp;10.20, MacOS-X, and various
versions of Linux.  Sources of the latest released version are
available freely from:

EP&nbsp;0.99 is a simple Bourne shell script calling E and the postprocessor in
a pipeline.

<h3>Strategies</h3>

E's automatic mode is optimized for performance on TPTP. The
optimization of E&nbsp;0.9 is based on about 90 test runs over the
library (and previous experience) and consists of the selection of one
of about 40 different strategies for each problem. All test runs have
been performed on SUN Ultra 60/300 machines with a time limit of 300
seconds (or roughly equivalent configurations). All individual
strategies are general purpose, the worst one solves about 49% of TPTP
3.0.1, the best one about 60%. We expect similar optimization for
E&nbsp;0.99.

E distinguishes problem classes based on a number of features, all of
which have between 2 and 4 possible values. The most important ones
are:

<ul>
<li> Is the most general non-negative clause unit, Horn, or Non-Horn?
<li> Is the most general negative clauce unit or non-unit?
<li> Are all negative clauses unit clauses?
<li> Are all literals equality literals, are some literas equality
     literals, or is the problem non-equational?
<li> Are there a few, some, or many clauses in the problem?
<li> Is the maximum arity of any function symbol 0, 1, 2, or greater? 
<li> Is the sum of function symbol arities in the signature small,
     medium, or large?
</ul>

Wherever there is a three-way split on a numerical feature value,
the limits are selected automatically with the aim of
splitting the set of problems into approximately equal
sized parts based on this one feature.

<p>
For classes above a threshold size, we assign the absolute best
heuristic to the class. For smaller, non-empty classes, we assign the
globally best heuristic that solves the same number of problems on
this class as the best heuristic on this class does. Empty classes are
assigned the globally best heuristic. Typically, most selected
heuristics are assigned to more than one class.


<h3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

In the last years, E performed well in most proof categories. We
believe that E will again be among the strongest provers in the MIX
category. Performance on FOF problems should be competitive and better
than in previous years. We hope that E will at least be a useful
complement to dedicated systems in the other categories.

<p>
EP&nbsp;0.99 will be hampered by the fact that it has to analyse the
inference step listing, an operation that typically is about as
expensive as the proof search itself. Nevertheless, it should be
competitive among the MIX* and FOF* systems.

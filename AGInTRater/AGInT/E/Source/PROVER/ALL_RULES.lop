# This will make E produce a proof using all inference rules but "ef"
# if called as follows:
# ./eprover -l4 --split-clauses=3 ALL_RULES.lop 
#
# "er"     Equality resolution: x!=a v x=x ==> a=a
# "pm"     Paramodulation
# "ef"     Equality factoring (BG94): x=a v b=c v x=d ==> 
#                                     a!=c v b=c vb=d  
# "split"  Clause splitting a la Vampire (non-deductive, but maintains
#          unsatisfiability)  
# "rw"     Rewriting, can mean repeated application (but only of one
#          equation in one direction
# "sr"     Simplify-reflect: a=b and f(a)!=f(b) => empty clause
# "ar"     AC-resolution: Delete literals that are trivial modulo the
#          AC-theory induced by the named clauses
# "cn"     Clause normalize, delete trivial and repeated literals

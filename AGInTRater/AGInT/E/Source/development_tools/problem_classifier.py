Usage: problem_classifier.py [-r<format1> ...-r<formatn>]  <protocols>

Read a set of E protocols and suggest various assignments of protocols
(i.e. heuristics) to proof problems. Only problems occurring in the
best overal protocol are handled.

Options:

-r<format>: Select an algorithms for computing the
            assignment.
     Available:

     const   : Each problem is assigned the globally best heuristic
               that solves it.
     equidist: Times are rounded to the nearest k seconds, each
               problem is assigned the globally best heuristic that
               solves it in minimal time.
     prop    : Times are rounded to the nearest [1,2,5]*10^X, each
               problem is assigned the globally best heuristic that
               solves it in minimal time.
     log     : Times are rounded to the nearest k*2^X, each
               problem is assigned the globally best heuristic that
               solves it in minimal time.
     none    : Each problem is assigned the globally best heuristic
               that solves it in minimal time.

equidist and log accept an numeric argument for k, e.g. -rlog0.5 or
-requidist10.

Suggestions are preceded by an mnemonic string denoting the algorithm
and a colon, so you can grep and cut suitable results out. Parsing is
expensive, computing assignments is cheap, so it makes sense to
compute all assignments at once. Other output fields are problem name,
status, and suggested class.

If no -r option is given, uses prop algorithm, but ommits mnemonic
strings.

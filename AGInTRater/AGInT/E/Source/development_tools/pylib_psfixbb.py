pylib_psfixbb.py 1.1

Usage: psfixbb [Options] <file> ...

Set tight bounding boxes for encapsulated (and some other) PostScript
files. 

Many programs will generate PostScript with bounding boxes that are
much larger than necessary. psfixbb will use the ghostscript
interpreter to determine a tight bounding box for the PostScript files
given on the command line and will change the first bounding box in
each file accordingly. For multi-page files with multiple bounding
boxes, the new bounding box will fit all pages.

psfixbb will not try to insert a bounding box into a file that does
not already have one. In that case it will leave the original file
unmodified.

Restriction: For simplicity, psfixbb will read the whole file into
memory. This should not be a problem with current memory sizes and
typical PostScript files. If your files are larger than your swap
space, you are in trouble.

Options:

-h

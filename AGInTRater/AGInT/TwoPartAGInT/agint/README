Generation of interesting formulae
	$ seek.pl -p AXIOMS_FILE [-a PROOVER_NAME -i ITERATION_SIZE 
		  -l MAX_ITERATIONS -q QUIETNESS_LEVEL]

Evaluation of formulae for interestingness
	$ rate.pl AXIOMS_FILE FORMULAE_FILE

+ All output is sent to stdout
+ FORMULAE_FILE needs to contain all axioms from AXIOMS_FILE within it.
  The reason is that AXIOMS_FILE axioms are used to build stats. tables,
  but can have the original names. FORMULAE_FILE axioms must be named by
  the same naming convention as the rest of the formulae (provers do renaming)
